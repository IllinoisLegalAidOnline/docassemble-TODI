  This program can make a joint TODI for a property with two owners: you and your joint owner. The property must be held in **{joint tenancy}** or **{tenancy by the entirety}**.
  
  It cannot make a joint TODI for a property with three or more owners, or for a property owned by **{tenants in common}**. If the property is owned by three or more people, you may file separate TODIs or [**Get Legal Help**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/get-legal-help).

question: |
  Information about TODIs
subquestion: |
  A TODI can be used to transfer any type of real property. This means a house, a condo, a building, or a parcel of land.
  
  To complete this program, you will need to know: 

  * Your Property Index Number ("PIN"), which should be on your deed, your property tax bill, and other documents recorded against the property. You can obtain the PIN from your County Clerk's Office, Assessor's Office, and sometimes at your county's website. It is sometimes called a "parcel number" or a "permanent index number."

  * The legal description of the property. You can find this in the property deed or other documents recorded against the property. If you do not have these, you can find them at the office of County Recorder of Deeds or their website. For example, in St. Clair County, you would go to the Recorder of Deeds website and search for your deed using your PIN. You could then view an image of the deed which contains the legal description.

template: bonus_info
subject: |
  **Taxes, property rights, and mortgages**
content: |
  During your lifetime, you will not need to pay additional taxes due to the TODI. You still need to pay local property taxes. However, the property will be subject to the estate tax after your death. If the value of your estate is high enough, your estate will have to pay an estate tax.
  
  You will still have all your property rights after making a TODI. You can do anything with the property that an owner has the right to do, including selling the property or using it as collateral on a loan. A beneficiary will not have any rights to the property until your death.

  You can file a TODI even if your property has a mortgage. It will not affect the mortgage during your lifetime. The mortgage would follow the property, so if there is still a mortgage in place after your death, your beneficiary will inherit the property subject to that mortgage. Your beneficiary will need to make arrangements with any lenders to continue paying the mortgage.

  joint tenants: |
    **Joint tenant** owners all own an equal share of the property. For example, if there are three joint tenant owners, each owner owns 1/3rd of the property. Joint tenant owners also have what the law calls a right of survivorship. This means that when a joint tenant owner passes away, their share of the property goes to the other joint tenant owners.
  tenants in common: |
    **Tenants in common** may have equal or unequal shares. For example, one owner could own an 80% share of the property and another owner could own a 20% share of the property. These percentages must add up to 100%. Tenant-in-common owners do not have the right of survivorship. If a tenant in common passes away, their share of the property goes to their estate instead of the remaining tenants in common.
  joint tenancy: |
    **Joint tenant** owners all own an equal share of the property. For example, if there are three joint tenant owners, each owner owns 1/3rd of the property. Joint tenant owners also have what the law calls a 'right of survivorship.' This means that when a joint tenant owner passes away, their share of the property goes to the other joint tenant owners.
  tenancy by the entirety: |
    A **tenancy by the entirety** can only exist when a property is owned by a married couple. It is similar to a joint tenancy. If one spouse passes away, the other spouse gets their share of the property. The property's deed must explicitly state the couple owns the property as tenants by the entirety.
